# Deploying users

Currently, the process to deploy accounts to the seedbox is to edit the deployuser.sh script: 
- replace the ip variable with your seedbox IP
- update the four arrays as appropriate
- update the array count for loop iteration

There is also a script for rTorrent-o-meter, a munin plugin to gather statistics on rTorrent utilisation, to be added in the future.
