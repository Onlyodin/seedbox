# seedbox
Just a simple tool for deploying a private seedbox

This is a tool that I have been working on to deploy rTorrent, ruTorrent, and local users onto a machine that will be running as a seedbox.

Suggestions and contributions are welcome.

This project is broken down into two main sections; the installer script that creates users and associated components such as ruTorrent configuration files, and a basic HTML root that the users of the seedbox can use to see some statistical information (grahps, disk quota info, etc) as well as containing quick links to the ruTorrent web interface, and even a directory listing page for http access to downloaded files.
